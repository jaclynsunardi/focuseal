## UI Principles

- **Mindful Minimalism** ‚Äì minimal UI surfaces, lots of white space
- **Subtle Feedback** ‚Äì smooth animations, non-disruptive transitions
- **Rounded Aesthetic** ‚Äì large rounded corners for buttons and cards
- **Dark Mode Compatible** ‚Äì always design with light & dark themes in mind
- **Focus-First Hierarchy** ‚Äì highlight core actions (e.g., timer, block apps) above all

## Usage Tips

- Avoid sharp, high-contrast color pairings (e.g., red on blue).
- Stick to the core color palette unless introducing system states (e.g., OS notifications).
- Animate only key productivity moments (e.g., Pomodoro start/end, app blocked).
- Default to calm ‚Äî this is a product to help users feel *in control*.
