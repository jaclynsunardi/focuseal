## Typography

| Role         | Font             | Purpose                         |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Headings     | `Inter SemiBold` | Clean, modern, legible          |
| Body Text    | `IBM Plex Sans`  | Neutral, high readability       |
| Timer / Data | `Space Mono`     | Monospaced for alignment        |

Fonts are selected for balance between clarity and personality. Always prioritize legibility.


## UI Principles

- **Mindful Minimalism** – minimal UI surfaces, lots of white space
- **Subtle Feedback** – smooth animations, non-disruptive transitions
- **Rounded Aesthetic** – large rounded corners for buttons and cards
- **Dark Mode Compatible** – always design with light & dark themes in mind
- **Focus-First Hierarchy** – highlight core actions (e.g., timer, block apps) above all

## Usage Tips

- Avoid sharp, high-contrast color pairings (e.g., red on blue).
- Stick to the core color palette unless introducing system states (e.g., OS notifications).
- Animate only key productivity moments (e.g., Pomodoro start/end, app blocked).
- Default to calm — this is a product to help users feel *in control*.
